/*  
 ** The .active class is automatically added to the <NavLink> when the route it points to is currently active. When this happens, the associated <hr> becomes visible because of the @apply block rule. 
** The rule ::-webkit-scrollbar { @apply hidden; } hides the scrollbar in WebKit browsers by applying the hidden utility, enhancing the visual appearance of the UI by removing the default scrollbar. */
